      <summary>I. Introduction – What Is American Strategy?</summary>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>1. How American “Strategy” Went Astray</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Strategy should connect <strong>ends and means</strong> with clear priorities, not be a wish list.</li>
          <li>Post–Cold War elites assumed permanent U.S. global domination was desirable and feasible.</li>
          <li>U.S. foreign policy overextended:
            <ul>
              <li>Took on global burdens with little connection to core U.S. interests.</li>
              <li>Tried to fund a large welfare–administrative state and a huge global security role at the same time.</li>
              <li>Backed globalism and “free trade” that hollowed out U.S. industry and the middle class.</li>
              <li>Allowed allies to offload defense costs and drag the U.S. into peripheral conflicts.</li>
              <li>Gave excessive power to international institutions that undermined national sovereignty.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Result: pursuit of an impossible goal while weakening the very foundations of U.S. power.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. President Trump’s Necessary, Welcome Correction</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Trump’s first term is presented as a course correction:
            <ul>
              <li>Restored border control and redirected the military to defend U.S. sovereignty.</li>
              <li>Invested heavily in the armed forces and rebuilt alliances with higher allied defense spending.</li>
              <li>Used tariffs and energy policy to revive American industry and independence.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Diplomatic achievements: negotiated peace or de-escalation in eight conflicts across multiple regions.</li>
          <li>Second term aims to:
            <ul>
              <li>Define what the U.S. should want.</li>
              <li>Identify means available.</li>
              <li>Unify ends and means into a coherent National Security Strategy.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Domestic agenda further strengthens means:
            <ul>
              <li>Restores competence and merit; removes DEI-type practices.</li>

        <h2>B. Strategic Principles (“America First”)</h2>

        <h3>1. Core Principles</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Focused national interest:</strong> not everything is a vital interest.</li>
          <li><strong>Peace through strength:</strong> military, economic, technological, and cultural power deter conflict.</li>
          <li><strong>Predisposition to non-intervention:</strong> high bar for intervening in other nations’ affairs.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible realism:</strong> work pragmatically with different regimes without trying to remake them.</li>
          <li><strong>Primacy of nations:</strong> nation-state is core political unit; sovereignty should be protected.</li>
          <li><strong>Sovereignty & respect:</strong> resist foreign censorship, influence operations, and immigration manipulation.</li>
          <li><strong>Balance of power:</strong> prevent any adversary from achieving regional or global dominance.</li>
          <li><strong>Pro-American worker:</strong> policy favors broad-based prosperity, not just aggregate GDP growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Fairness in alliances and trade:</strong> end free-riding and persistent imbalances.</li>
          <li><strong>Competence and merit:</strong> preserve them as core civilizational advantages; resist ideologies that undermine them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Priority Themes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>End of mass migration:</strong> border security as primary national security task.</li>
          <li><strong>Protection of rights and liberties:</strong> no abuse of state power under pretexts like “protecting democracy.”</li>
          <li><strong>Burden-sharing and burden-shifting:</strong> allies must take primary responsibility for their regions and raise defense spending (e.g., NATO 5% pledge).</li>
          <li><strong>Realignment through peace:</strong> presidential diplomacy to resolve conflicts and strengthen U.S. influence.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic security:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Balanced, reciprocal trade; oppose dumping and unfair barriers.</li>
              <li>Secure access to critical supply chains and materials.</li>
              <li>Reindustrialization and reshoring of strategic production.</li>
              <li>Revitalized defense industrial base, including low-cost and high-end capabilities.</li>
              <li>Energy dominance in oil, gas, coal, nuclear; rejection of “Net Zero” ideology.</li>
              <li>Preserve and grow U.S. dominance in global finance and capital markets.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
