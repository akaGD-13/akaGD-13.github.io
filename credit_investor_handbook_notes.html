      <h2>Part One: Building Blocks of the Leveraged Credit Markets</h2>

      <!-- Topic 1 -->
      <details open>
        <summary><strong>1. A Brief History of Leveraged Credit Markets</strong></summary>

        <h4>🔹 Debt Basics</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Does not require giving up ownership; interest payments are tax-deductible, whereas dividends are not.</li>
          <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires timely payments of interest/principal; failure to do so can lead to bankruptcy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🔹 What is the Leveraged Credit Market?</h4>
        <p>Refers to corporate bonds and loans issued by companies <strong>below investment grade (Baa3 / BBB-)</strong>. Also known as:
        <br>High Yield (HY), Sub-investment grade, Speculative grade, Junk debt.
        </p>

        <h4>🔹 Three Major Segments of Non-Investment-Grade Debt</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>High Yield (HY) Bonds</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Broadly Syndicated Loans (BSL)</strong> — leveraged loans / bank loans / bank debt</li>
          <li><strong>Private Credit / Direct Lending</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <h4>🔹 1 High Yield (HY) Bonds</h4>
        <p>
          Michael Milken contributed to the corporate bond field
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Created a new source of capital for the huge universe of companies without investment-grade ratings.</li>
          <li>Fueled economic growth and job creation by enabling companies to invest in growth initiatives.</li>
          <li>Provided investors, including endowment and pension funds, with higher-yielding investment opportunities.</li>
          <li>Provided a catalyst for corporate governance improvements by facilitating takeovers of under-managed companies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>🔹 2 Broadly Syndicated Loans (BSL) / Leveraged Loans</h4>
        <p><strong>Key differences vs HY bonds:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Less liquid; generally only purchased by <strong>Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs)</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Secured by collateral</strong> — sits higher in the capital structure</li>
          <li><strong>Loans are not securities</strong> — less subject to securities laws like insider trading</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>CLOs (Collateralized Loan Obligations)</h4>
        <p>A CLO manager bundles 100+ leveraged loans into a pooled vehicle and issues securities (tranches) to investors from AAA to equity.</p>
        <p><strong>Why they matter:</strong> The strength or weakness of the CLO market (the “CLO bid”) directly impacts financing costs for LBO transactions.</p>

        <h4>🔹 3 Private Credit / Direct Lending</h4>
        <p>Direct lenders (Apollo, Ares, Blackstone, Golub, Owl Rock, etc.) 
          increasingly compete with banks in middle-market lending.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it's growing:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Senior secured debt has provided excellent risk‐adjusted returns through various market cycles.</li>
          <li>The floating‐rate structure of private credit insulates investors from increasing interest rates.</li>
          <li>Well‐structured senior secured debt has historically fared better than most asset classes in a recession.</li>
        </ul>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>2. Patterns Across Credit Cycles</strong></summary>
        <h4>🔄 Four Phases</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> growth and easier credit; defaults remain low.</li>
          <li><strong>Downturn:</strong> defaults rise as growth slows and liquidity tightens.</li>
          <li><strong>Repair:</strong> defaults begin to decline as balance sheets are fixed.</li>
          <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> credit standards relax; risk appetite returns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>📉 Notable Downturns</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1997–1998:</strong> Asian Financial Crisis and contagion across emerging markets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2000–2002:</strong> Dot-com/TMT bubble burst. Normalization late 2002 driven by:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Monetary policy:</strong> Fed cut the funds rate from 6% (Jan 2001) to 1.8% (Dec 2001).</li>
              <li><strong>Fiscal policy:</strong> 2001 Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act lowered rates and raised the child tax credit.</li>
              <li><strong>Diminishing fear of follow-on attacks:</strong> reduced risk aversion post-9/11.</li>
              <li><strong>Enhanced regulation:</strong> bipartisan reforms after accounting scandals (e.g., Enron) improved reporting accuracy.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2008–2009:</strong> Global Financial Crisis/Great Recession; mortgage-backed securities at the core.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2020:</strong> Global pandemic and sudden-stop recession.
          </li>

        <summary><strong>4. Primer on Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)</strong></summary>

        <p>LBO: is the acquisition of a company by a private equity (PE) firm using a significant amount of debt relative to equity.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Financial Sponsor / Sponsor / Financial Buyer:</strong> the PE firm</li>
          <li><strong>The target:</strong> the company being acquired</li>
          <li><strong>Sponsor financing / Acquisition financing:</strong> the debt raised to fund the LBO</li>
          <li><strong>Portfolio company:</strong> a company acquired by a PE fund</li>
        </ul>

        <p>60-75% normally</p>

        <p>The credit markets have also evolved to include debt financing options with lower cash servicing requirements and fewer borrower restrictions, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Paid‐in‐kind (PIK) coupons:</strong> allow the borrower to defer cash interest payments by paying with new debt rather than cash, thus preserving liquidity</li>
          <li><strong>Covenant‐light (“cov‐lite”) loans:</strong> do not require maintenance of financial ratios such as leverage and coverage</li>
          <li><strong>Recurring revenue loans:</strong> lender focuses on revenue rather than cash flow</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A PE firm raises multiple funds to make investments. Each fund typically has a 10‐year life. The PE firm acquires companies in the first four to six years (the investment period). During the last four to six years, it monetizes those investments (the harvest period).</p>

        <p>In the investment period, the PE sponsor has the goals summarized in</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Identifying/sourcing investment opportunities
            <ul>
              <li>Auctions</li>
              <li>Proprietary deals</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Negotiating the acquisition</li>
          <li>Financing the debt component and closing the deal</li>
        </ol>

        <p>After making an acquisition, the sponsor focuses on harvesting in two ways, summarized in:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Improving the company</li>
          <li>Returning capital to investors: dividend, sales of the business, IPO…</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Sell-Side M&A process:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The target selects a sell‐side advisor.</li>
          <li>The investment bank performs due diligence, including a preliminary valuation of the business.</li>
          <li>The investment bank in consultation with the company identifies a buyer universe</li>
          <li>The bank prepares and distributes marketing materials to the buyer universe.</li>
          <li>The bank runs the auction.</li>
          <li>The target and its advisor pick a winner.</li>
          <li>The acquisition closes</li>
        </ol>
