      <h2>Dalio's View on Market Bubble, Credit Cycle Dynamics, and Global Power Shifts</h2>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>1) Current Market Environment: Signs of a Bubble, but Not an Imminent Crash</h3>
        <p>Ray Dalio indicates that today’s financial markets are definitely in a bubble. However, he emphasizes that this does not necessarily mean a near-term market crash. The reason is that liquidity remains abundant, and credit markets are still functioning normally. Historically, bubbles do not burst merely due to high valuations; they tend to collapse only when liquidity tightens and investors are forced to convert paper wealth into cash.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>2) Equity Wealth-to-Money Ratio at Alarmingly High Levels</h3>
        <p>According to Dalio, the ratio of U.S. equity wealth to total money supply has reached extremely elevated levels. These levels closely resemble two major historical bubble episodes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The late 1920s, just before the Great Depression, and</li>
          <li>The late 1990s dot-com bubble.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Such elevated ratios suggest excessive financial wealth relative to actual money available to support valuations, which increases systemic vulnerability during liquidity contractions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>3) Long-Term Return Expectations</h3>
        <p>Dalio further suggests that due to these extreme conditions, real stock market returns over the next decade could be close to zero. This implies that traditional equity-heavy portfolios might experience low real returns, despite nominal gains, especially in an inflationary or tightening-liquidity environment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>4) Integrating Dalio’s View with Credit Cycle Theory</h3>
        <p>Recently, I learned more about the credit cycle, which connects closely with Dalio’s insights. During the late stages of a credit cycle, default rates begin to rise, credit becomes more expensive or scarce, and the value of corporate credit instruments declines. Historically, many major financial crises originate in the credit markets, not equity markets.</p>
        <p>This underscores the importance of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining cash reserves or liquidity,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So that when defaults peak and asset prices drop, we are positioned to buy undervalued assets during the recovery phase.</p>
        <p>Therefore, understanding and timing the credit cycle is critical not only for risk management but also for capitalizing on distressed opportunities.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>5) Geopolitical Implications: Global Power Rotation</h3>
        <p>Connecting to Dalio’s Principle #2 video, he illustrates the historical rotation of global dominant powers, showing that national strength tends to rise and fall in cyclical patterns. According to his framework, the United States is gradually declining in relative power while China is ascending, and these lines are approaching a crossover point. This convergence increases the likelihood of geopolitical tension, trade conflict, and technological decoupling.</p>
        <p>However, in my view, China’s long-term ability to challenge U.S. dominance—especially in currency leadership—remains limited, because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>China is still structurally a developing economy,</li>
          <li>A major portion of its labor force is engaged in low-skill, manufacturing and labor-intensive sectors,</li>
          <li>It lacks the depth of high-tech, service-based, and innovation-driven sectors that are foundational for reserve currency status.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Therefore, while China may rise economically and politically, the U.S. dollar’s dominance is unlikely to be replaced by the RMB in the foreseeable future, given trust, legal systems, capital openness, and technological depth.</p>

        <h2>Japan Issue</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways from Video about Japan Treasury/Stock/Economics and Its Future Global Effects:  </h3>
        <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1iYSgB5EHf" target="_blank">🔗【日本的金融风险，如何先炸掉自己然后炸掉全世界的股市】</a>
        
        <p>Japan’s economy is facing serious challenges. Japanese government bond yields have risen significantly, and the yen has depreciated to around 150 per U.S. dollar. Investors are losing confidence in Japan’s ability to repay its debt, so they are unwilling to buy Japanese bonds. To encourage demand and defend its credibility, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised interest rates. However, this caused bond prices to fall sharply, creating losses for pension and retirement funds holding large amounts of Japanese government bonds.</p>

        <p>Normally, rising bond yields support stock market growth, but because the U.S. stock market recently experienced a drawdown, Japanese equities also fell. This has resulted in both bond and stock markets declining simultaneously, creating major losses for Japan’s pension systems. Market expectations of future rate changes can be inferred from the yield curve.</p>

        <p>Japan had previously set a ceiling for 10-year Japanese government bond yields under Yield Curve Control (YCC), promising to buy bonds to enforce the ceiling. But since the market kept testing the ceiling and doubting Japan’s credit, the BoJ kept raising the ceiling and eventually removed it, causing yields to surge.</p>

        <p>Currently, around 70% of the BoJ’s balance sheet consists of Japanese government bonds, and it owns about 50% of the total debt in the market. Japan used this bond-buying system to sustain zero interest rates and encourage banks to lend. When banks lend, they simply create money, but when borrowers repay, the money flows into the real economy — this is seen as printing money.</p>

        <p>Instead of flowing into domestic industries as intended, low interest rates allowed investors (like Warren Buffett) to borrow cheaply in Japan and invest in U.S. assets, pushing up U.S. equity markets.</p>

        <p>Now, as Japan raises interest rates and banks stop lending, investors will repatriate money by selling U.S. assets and buying yen. In theory, this should strengthen the yen, but in reality, the yen continues to depreciate. The reason is that bringing yen back actually increases the supply of yen in Japan, which weakens its value. This effect is the result of the past 10 years of zero rates and cannot be reversed quickly.</p>

        <p>Japan is trapped: If it doesn’t raise rates, markets will lose confidence and sell its bonds. But if it does raise rates, the BoJ and banks will suffer huge balance sheet losses due to their large debt holdings, and the repatriation of foreign investments will further weaken the yen. This situation is seen as the long-term consequence of Abenomics.</p>

        <p>Finally, according to the view presented, Sanae Takaichi’s new policy plan is to use Japan’s last remaining power to boost the U.S. stock market. After that, in a few months, the Japanese economy could collapse and the yen could depreciate sharply.</p>

        <h3>🔄 Logic Flow / Back Map (Based on Your Reasoning)</h3>
        <pre><code>Japan’s Economic Situation
│
├─ Bond Yields Increase
│   ├─ Investors doubt Japan’s ability to repay debt
│   ├─ No one buying Japanese bonds → BoJ forced to raise rates
│   ├─ Removing yield ceiling → Yields surge
│   └─ Higher yields → Bond price drop → Pension/retirement fund losses
│
├─ Stock Market Declines
│   ├─ Normally yields↑ → stocks↑
│   └─ But US stock drawdown → Japan stocks also fall
│       └─ Combined bond + equity losses → Pension crisis
│
├─ Role of Bank of Japan (BoJ)
│   ├─ Owned 50% of all Japanese bonds
│   ├─ 70% of BoJ balance sheet = JGBs
│   ├─ Used YCC to maintain 0% rates (bond buying)
│   └─ Zero rates meant to push money into real industry
│       └─ But investors used cheap yen to invest in US markets instead
│
├─ Effects of Raising Rates Now
│   ├─ Banks stop lending → money flows back to Japan
│   ├─ Investors sell US assets → buy Yen
│   ├─ In theory → Yen strengthens
│   └─ But in practice → Yen depreciates
│       ├─ Because money returns to Japan economy (printing effect)
│       └─ Yen supply increases → Yen value falls
│
├─ Longer-Term Effects
│   ├─ 10 years of 0% rates created structural problems
│   ├─ Japan forced to raise rates or lose credibility
│   ├─ But raising rates harms BoJ/banks’ balance sheets
│   └─ Repatriation paradoxically weakens Yen
│
└─ Final Claims
    ├─ Situation is a result of Abenomics
    ├─ Future policy (Sanae Takaichi): boost US market
    └─ Japan may collapse soon; Yen could sharply depreciate
