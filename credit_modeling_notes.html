        <h3>Credit Modeling Overview</h3>
      <!-- 1. Credit modeling overview (page 2) -->
      <details open>
        <summary>1. Credit Modeling Overview</summary>
        <p>
          The deck distinguishes three broad areas where credit models are used:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Loan credit analysis and management (banking book):</strong>
            assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers and managing loan portfolios.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trading book credit risk:</strong>
            modeling defaults and credit migrations for traded instruments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fixed income investment:</strong>
            analyzing credit spreads and their drivers for bond and spread products.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each area has a different objective and therefore uses different models and risk-management
          practices. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </p>

      <!-- 2. Loan credit analysis & management (pages 3–4) -->
      <details>
        <summary>2. Loan Credit Analysis & Risk Management</summary>

        <h3>2.1 Loan Credit Analysis (Banking Book)</h3>
        <p>
          Loan credit analysis is primarily relevant for the banking book, where the goal is to evaluate
          a borrower <em>before</em> making a loan.
        </p>
        <p>Key focus areas differ for commercial and retail borrowers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Commercial loans:</strong> balance sheet strength, cash flow generation,
            market performance, and overall company performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retail loans:</strong> credit scores (e.g., FICO), tax returns, existing
            indebtedness, savings, job security, and geographic or demographic factors.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Loan Credit Risk Management</h3>
        <p>
          Once loans are in the portfolio, risk is managed differently than in a trading book:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analyze the borrower carefully before granting credit.</li>
          <li>Adjust loan pricing (interest rate) to compensate for borrower risk.</li>
          <li>Avoid excessive concentration in specific borrowers or sectors.</li>
          <li>
            After origination, monitor collateral values, payment timeliness, and covenants;
            restructure loans if necessary, and seize collateral as a last resort.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <!-- 3. Trading book credit risk & fixed income investment (page 5) -->
      <details>
        <summary>3. Trading Book Credit Risk & Fixed Income Investment</summary>

        <h3>3.1 Trading Book Credit Risk</h3>
        <p>
          Trading book credit risk models focus on default events and credit quality changes.
          They typically analyze:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Default probabilities.</li>
          <li>Rating transitions and migration matrices.</li>
          <li>Recovery rates given default.</li>
          <li>
            Credit spread behavior (distinct from pure spread volatility, which overlaps with
            general market risk).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Two main classes of default models are referenced:
          <strong>reduced-form models</strong> and <strong>structural models</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Fixed Income Investment</h3>
        <p>
          For fixed income investors, the central variable is the <strong>credit spread</strong>.
          Typical analyses include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Volatility and term structure of spreads.</li>
          <li>Impact of spread movements on bond prices.</li>
          <li>
            Links between credit spreads and macro or market factors
            (equity index levels, interest rates, volatility indices, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>Statistical relationships used in relative-value and factor models.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Modeling approaches often use regressions or other statistical tools to link spreads
          with explanatory variables.
        </p>
      </details>

      <!-- 4. Default modeling frameworks (pages 7–8) -->
       <h3>Default Modeling Overview</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>4. Default Modeling Frameworks</summary>

        <h3>4.1 Traditional Taxonomy: Reduced-Form vs Structural Models</h3>
        <p>
          Historically, default models were divided into two categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduced-form models:</strong>
            model the timing of default directly via an exogenous process
            (often with an exponentially distributed default time), without modeling the
            firm’s asset value explicitly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Structural models:</strong>
            model firm value as a continuous process and define default as
            the first time that assets fall below a default barrier (e.g., the level of liabilities).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Contemporary View</h3>
        <p>
          Modern classification focuses more on <em>information content</em> than on strict model form:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At one end, reduced-form models assume limited information about firm fundamentals;
            default time is unpredictable and described via a hazard-rate process.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the other end, structural models assume rich information about the firm, so
            default can be anticipated when asset value approaches the barrier.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In practice, real-world models lie on a continuum between these extremes, adjusting
          assumptions about information and uncertainty.
        </p>
      </details>

      <!-- 5. Reduced-form survival framework (pages 9–11) -->
      <details>
        <summary>5. Reduced-Form Models & Survival Analysis</summary>

        <h3>5.1 Default Time & Survival Probability</h3>
        <p>
          Reduced-form models treat default time as a random stopping time. The key functions are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>τ</strong>: default time.</li>
          <li><strong>s(t)</strong>: survival probability, i.e., probability of no default before time <em>t</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>p(t)</strong>: default time probability density.</li>
          <li><strong>λ(t)</strong>: hazard rate, the instantaneous default intensity at time <em>t</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Relationships from survival analysis connect these quantities, for example
          (schematically):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>s(t) = 1 − CDF(t)</code></li>
          <li><code>p(t) = − d s(t) / dt</code></li>
          <li><code>λ(t) = p(t) / s(t)</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Constant Hazard Rate Example</h3>
        <p>
          With a constant hazard rate <code>λ</code>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Survival: <code>s(t) = e<sup>−λt</sup></code>.</li>
          <li>Density: <code>p(t) = λ e<sup>−λt</sup></code>.</li>
          <li>Expected default time: <code>E[τ] = 1/λ</code>; variance: <code>1/λ²</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This corresponds to an exponential distribution: default time is memoryless and
          unpredictable, a common assumption in basic intensity models.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Survival Curves (Graph Slide)</h3>
        <p>
          One slide shows several survival probability curves for different constant hazard rates
          (e.g., 50, 200, 500, 1000 bps). Higher hazard rates cause the survival curve to fall
          more quickly toward zero, illustrating how more credit risk compresses the expected
          lifetime of the obligor.
        </p>
      </details>

      <!-- 6. Pricing and spread–hazard conversions (pages 13–16) -->
      <details>
        <summary>6. Pricing & Spread–Hazard Conversions</summary>

        <h3>6.1 Valuing a Risky Cash Flow</h3>
        <p>
          Consider a risky payment of 1 dollar at time <em>T</em>, with recovery rate <em>R</em>
          if default occurs. Loss given default (LGD) is <code>1 − R</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a reduced-form setting under the risk-neutral measure, the value decomposes into:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A survival leg (payment if no default before <em>T</em>).</li>
          <li>A default leg (recovery payment if default occurs before <em>T</em>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Using survival probability <code>s(t)</code> and hazard rate <code>λ(t)</code>,
          the bond price can be expressed as discounted expectations of these legs.
        </p>

        <h3>6.2 From Hazard Rate to Spread</h3>
        <p>
          Given a constant hazard rate and an LGD, we can derive a constant credit spread
          that equates a risky bond to a risk-free bond:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Roughly, higher hazard rate or higher LGD implies a larger spread over the
            risk-free curve.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.3 From Spread to Hazard Rate</h3>
        <p>
          Conversely, observed spreads can be inverted to estimate implied hazard rates.
          For example, given:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spread level <em>S</em>, maturity <em>T</em>, and LGD,</li>
          <li>We solve for the constant <code>λ</code> that makes the risky present value
              match the market price.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.4 Graph Slides: “Spread for Hazard” & “Hazard for Spread”</h3>
        <p>
          Two slides show:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For a fixed hazard rate (e.g., 2% per year), how the implied spread behaves under
            different recoveries (0% vs 40% recovery).
          </li>
          <li>
            For a fixed credit spread (e.g., 200 bps), how the implied hazard rate varies
            with maturity and recovery assumptions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <!-- 7. Time-dependent hazard, properties, and utility (pages 17–19) -->
      <details>
        <summary>7. Time-Dependent Hazard: Properties & Uses</summary>

        <h3>7.1 General Properties</h3>
        <p>
          When hazard rates vary over time, default times are modeled using a
          non-homogeneous Poisson process. Important points:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Waiting times between potential default events are independent but not
            identically distributed when the intensity changes over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            The process is no longer memoryless; knowing that an obligor has survived
            to a given time can change the conditional probability of default.
          </li>
          <li>
            Piecewise-constant hazard rates are commonly used to calibrate to CDS spreads
            at specific maturities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The survival curve <code>s(t)</code> is monotone decreasing with non-negative
            intensity <code>λ(t)</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.2 Utility of Default Time Distributions</h3>
        <p>
          Time-dependent intensity models are applied to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>CDS pricing under independence assumptions.</li>
          <li>Extension to risky bond pricing.</li>
          <li>
            CVA calculations when portfolio exposure is assumed independent of default
            time (no wrong-way risk).
          </li>
          <li>
            Market risk analysis by shocking hazard rates or spreads to measure P&amp;L
            sensitivity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.3 Extension: Stochastic Intensities</h3>
        <p>
          The deck briefly notes that reduced-form models can be extended by making
          the hazard rate itself stochastic. Model behavior then depends on the
          dynamics chosen for the intensity process (e.g., mean-reversion, volatility).
        </p>
      </details>

      <!-- 8. Spread modeling (pages 20–22) -->
      <details>
        <summary>8. Spread Modeling</summary>

        <h3>8.1 Decomposing the Credit Spread</h3>
        <p>
          The spread on a risky bond can be decomposed into:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Real default component</strong> derived from hazard rates and LGD (sometimes
            called the “default spread”).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Market price of risk component</strong> which compensates investors for
            bearing systematic or model risk, beyond expected losses.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8.2 Mapping Default Probabilities to Spreads</h3>
        <p>
          Given risk-neutral default probabilities (via a survival curve), we can derive
          the credit spread consistent with observed prices:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Start from the risky cash-flow valuation (survival leg + default leg).
          </li>
          <li>
            Express the result as a discount factor with an effective risky rate
            <code>r + S</code>, where <em>S</em> is the credit spread.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rearrange to obtain <em>S</em> as a function of LGD and survival probability.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8.3 Real-World vs Risk-Neutral Spreads</h3>
        <p>
          A final slide presents the idea that the observed spread consists of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>S = S_d + S_m</code>, where <code>S_d</code> is the spread implied by
              real-world default risk and <code>S_m</code> captures the “market price of risk”.</li>
          <li>
            Empirical work suggests that <code>S_m</code> is often proportional to spread
            volatility, so that <code>S_m = m σ</code>, where <em>m</em> is the price of
            spread risk per unit of volatility.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <!--

        you can either:
        - Insert <img> tags pointing to PNGs of the figures, or
        - Recreate them with a plotting library and link screenshots here.
